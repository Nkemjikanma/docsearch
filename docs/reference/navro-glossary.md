## Acquirer

An acquirer, or acquiring bank, is a bank that serves merchants. It is licensed to provide merchant accounts to qualified businesses, enabling those businesses to process payment card transactions. These banks help merchants by 'acquiring' funds from cardholder banks when payment card transactions are processed. The funds are then deposited into a merchant account, which the acquirer provides and maintains for the merchant.

Acquirers are members of one or more card brand networks. Examples of card brands include Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover.

## Account Information Service Provider (AISP)

AISP status is awarded and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Accredited organisations can help customers to access account information from separate bank accounts via a single portal. These services are usually designed to help users manage spending and plan their finances.

Being an authorised AISP means that businesses can ask for permission to connect to a bank account, and use that bank account information to provide a service. However, they cannot move a customer's money.

## Anti-impersonation check

A check to confirm that the person presenting the information is who they claim to be. For example, a check requiring that the ID matches the face of the person presenting it.

Running an electronic credit check to verify name, address and date of birth is not sufficient to do this.

## Application Programming Interface (API)

A machine-to-machine interface. Navro has developed a public-facing API that enables marketplaces to interact securely with us to instruct payments.

***

## Bacs

Previously known as Bankers' Automated Clearing System. An electronic system for making payments directly from one bank account to another. Mainly used for direct debits and direct credits from organisations.

Payments take three working days to clear. For example, money paid into your account on Monday will clear on Wednesday.

## Beneficiary

The ultimate recipient of a payment. This can be either an individual or a company.

### Beneficiary account

The account that receives the payment.

See also: [Funding account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#funding-account), [Remitter account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#remitter-account), [Source account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#source-account).

### Beneficiary bank

The bank or financial institution that holds the beneficiary account.

## Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)

A type of short-term financing that enables consumers to make purchases and pay for them at a future date.

When you make a purchase using BNPL, the provider you have an account with pays for it on your behalf. You then repay the BNPL provider over an agreed length of time, in instalments.

***

## CHAPS

A Pound Sterling same-day system used to settle high-value wholesale payments as well as time-critical, lower-value payments. For example, buying or paying a deposit on a property.

## Correspondent bank

An Intermediary bank in the routing chain. Handles payments from one account to another, typically those of the [beneficiary banks](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#beneficiary-bank).

## Customer due diligence (CDD)

A requirement on Navro to carry out basic checks on individuals' IDs. For example, to confirm where their money comes from, and that they are not sanctioned.

***

## E-Money Institution (EMI)

An EMI is a legal person holding a license to issue electronic money or e-money. An e-money licence enables the holder to offer payment services and some other financial services products. However, you cannot operate as a bank or use 'bank' in your name or marketing materials.

Broadly speaking, e-money institutions can:

- accept customer funds and change them into e-money, but not manage them — customers can use e-money accounts as digital wallets, but they cannot earn interest on them or go overdrawn
- offer debit cards, account-to-account transfers, standing orders and direct debits, but not lending as a standalone product
- offer some digital financial services products, such as foreign currency exchange

Like full banking licences, e-money licences issued in EU countries enable you to offer your services in the rest of the EU and EEA.

## EU Wire Regulations

Laws that apply when the sender of a payment is not the user of the service.

These laws mean that all payments sent by regulated firms must include the details of the sender. For example, a bank cannot send all payments as 'Bank Limited'. It must send the name of the account holder as part of the payment.

Other details are also required (for example, the account number), so that the source of funds can be traced back to the original sender.

For more information, see [Regulation EU 2015/847](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32015R0847).

***

## Faster Payments Service (FPS)

A service that facilitates real-time payments of up to £1m for millions of individuals, businesses and charities across the UK. In other words, almost anyone with a bank account.

These payments are usually initiated either online or via mobile or telephone banking. This system is different to both [Bacs](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#bacs) and [CHAPS](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#chaps). Bacs is generally used to set-up a batch of payments in advance, while CHAPS mainly handles larger payments.

## Fiat

Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but by the government that issued it.

This currency does not have any intrinsic value and is usually made of a worthless or low-value material, such as a small piece of paper.

## Funding account

The virtual account, hosted by Navro, which funds the payments you make through our platform.

See also: [Beneficiary account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#beneficiary-account), [Remitter account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#remitter-account), [Source account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#source-account).

***

## Hub

The Navro platform's interface that enables the user to interact directly with the Navro API.

Previously referred to as the 'Portal'.

***

## Issuer

The cardholder’s bank. Issues payment cards to authorised consumers.

Like [acquiring banks](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#acquirer), issuers are also in-network with one or many card brands (sometimes called card associations).

***

## Party

The person or machine that makes a payment through Navro.

## Payer

The originator of a payment, or the person or legal entity on whose behalf funds are being sent.

Where possible, this will be the name that displays on the [beneficiary](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#beneficiary) bank statement.

## Payment gateway

Secure software services that process card transactions online, either through an ecommerce website or face-to-face via a card terminal.

Once the payment processor receives the issuers’ authorisation, the gateway completes the transaction by forwarding all the information to the merchant.

## Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP)

A financial institution that enables online payments without a credit or debit card.

Used by, among other entities, [acquirers](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#acquirer), delivery apps, ecommerce organisations, marketplaces, [payment gateways](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#payment-gateway) and other [payment institutions](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#payment-institution-pi) to execute financial transactions on behalf of their clients.

Businesses that are authorised PISPs can ask for permission to connect to a customer's bank account and initiate payments on the customer’s behalf.

## Payment institution (PI)

An entity that provides payment services including, but not limited to:

- the execution of payment transactions
- cash payments to payment accounts
- the withdrawal of cash from payment accounts
- money remittance
- acting as a [payment processor](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#payment-processor) for card transactions

## Payment processor

Technology companies that authorise and carry out transactions on behalf of the issuing or [acquiring bank](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#acquirer).

There are two types of payment processor:

- issuer processor — connects with the card schemes and [issuing banks](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#issuer) to manage card issuance, authorise transactions, provide the system of record and communicate with all the different clearing and settlement parties
- acquiring processor — appointed by a merchant to handle transactions from various channels, such as credit cards and debit cards for the acquiring bank

## Payment Service Provider (PSP)

Regulated digital transaction facilitators. They help business owners accept a variety of online payment methods, such as cash cards, credit cards, debit cards, e-wallets and online banking.

PSPs ensure that payment journeys are completed securely. From the start, when a payer enters their details and initiates a payment, to the end, when the [beneficiary](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#beneficiary) receives the payment.

## Payout partner

A payment firm, bank, money services business (MSB) or other regulated entity, whom Navro contracts or has a legal relationship with, to process payments on behalf of our underlying clients.

## Pooled account

An account where the client pays funds to a client account, instead of to a named bank account for that client. Often used by law firms that cannot create individual accounts for each client.

Pooled accounts are inherently risky, as the original remitter information may be lost or not sent with payments.

***

## Remitter account

The account a [party](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#party) uses to transfer funds from.

Where it sits varies with the use case. For example, if you send funds to your Navro balance, the remitter account is the external source of funds. However, if you make a payment through Navro, the remitter account is the Navro balance.

See also: [Beneficiary account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#beneficiary-account), [Funding account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#funding-account), [Source account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#source-account).

## Representment

This means submitting evidence to the bank, proving that a transaction was valid and that the cardholder's chargeback claim should be overturned.

## Rules-based alerts

A rules-based monitoring system will have a series of rules, for example:

- if the user's average payout amount is _X_, flag the account if this increases to twice the normal payout value
- if the user sends transactions of over $10,000, flag for review

***

## Safeguarded account

An account that holds client funds, separately from Navro's funds, in accordance with the [Payment Services Regulations, Section 23](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/752/regulation/23).

See also: [Segregated account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#segregated-account).

## Sanctions checks

Due diligence investigations performed on nearly all information that passes through Navro's systems. Ensures we do not pay an entity or individual whom we are prohibited from paying.

## Segregated account

An account, held by a financial institution, which is segregated from the institution's own funds and protected from the institution's creditors in the event of bankruptcy.

See also: [Safeguarded account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#safeguarded-account).

## Simplified due diligence (SDD)

Means the customer has been asked for the relevant information (for example, their name, address and date of birth), but that this information has not been checked or verified. In this case, there is a risk that the information is incomplete, inaccurate or possibly even misleading or false.

## Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)

A system of transactions created by the EU. Harmonises the transaction of cashless payments between euro countries.

European consumers, businesses and government agents who make payments by direct debit, instant card transfer and credit transfers use the SEPA architecture. This enables users to make cashless payments across borders for the same cost as for domestic payments. The single euro payment area is approved and regulated by the European Payment Council (EPC).

## Source account

The actual bank account from which payments through Navro are debited.

See also: [Beneficiary account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#beneficiary-account), [Funding account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#funding-account), [Remitter account](https://navro.readme.io/docs/navro-glossary#remitter-account).

***

## Virtual International Bank Account Number (vIBAN)

A virtual account reference number allocated by a banking or payments provider to provide local payment.

While a regular IBAN is matched 'one-to-one' with a bank account, with a virtual IBAN, you can have multiple unique vIBANs that all send payments into the same central bank account.

If you give each payee a unique vIBAN, the payee won’t have to enter any extra information, and it’s instantly clear where each payment has come from.
