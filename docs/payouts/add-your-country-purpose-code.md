The Navro API contains a `countryPurposeCode` field that enables you to provide the reason for your cross-border payout. For example, to pay a bill.

You should fill in this field when paying out to the following countries:

- Algeria
- Indonesia
- Jordan
- Kyrgyzstan
- South Africa
- United Arab Emirates

The payout may still be successful even if it does not contain this code. However, we recommend that you provide it to ensure the receiving bank does not reject the payment.

> ðŸš§ Note
>
> You can only use letters and numbers to fill in the `countryPurposeCode` field. Special characters are not permitted.
