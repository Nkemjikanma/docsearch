You can notify one or multiple approvers about a payout, prompting them to either approve or reject it. The notification is sent to the approvers via email.

***

## Send Approval Notifications

1. When making a payout, after completing the **Payout details** and **Beneficiary selection** dialog, select **Request approval**. You can do this for both individual and batch payouts.
2. In the **Notify approvers** dialog, select the user or users you want to approve the payout:

You then receive confirmation that the selected users have been notified of the payout:

The selected users then receive an email like this, notifying them of the payout that requires their approval:

After the approver selects **View Payout**, they are then taken to the **Payout details** dialog, where they can choose to approve or reject the payout:

### Re-send Approval Notifications

You can also re-send a notification to either the same or different approvers.

To do this:

1. Go to the **Payout details** dialog and select the **Re-send** button.
2. In the **Notify approvers** dialog, select the user or users you want to approve the payout.
