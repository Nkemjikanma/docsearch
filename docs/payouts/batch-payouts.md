In the Navro Hub, the **Batch payouts** page enables you to create, search for and approve batch payouts. You can also view their details.

***

## Create a Batch Payout

1. In the navigation panel, go to **Payouts > Batches**.
2. Select **Create payout**. This opens the **Upload file** screen. If you need to, you can download the template CSV file. This will help you to create a test batch payout.
3. Select **Upload file**, then:

   - locate and upload the local CSV file containing the [data for your batch payout](https://navro.readme.io/docs/batch-file-columns)
   - select **Next step** to open the **Review payouts** screen

   > ðŸš§ Note
   >
   > If your CSV file contains a space after the destination country, you will not be able to upload your batch. For example, `GBR` instead of `GBR`.
4. Review your payouts, then:

   - select **I have reviewed the payouts in this batch**
   - select **Initiate batch to open the Overview screen**

5. Select **Request approval**. Alternatively, select **View Batch** to display the Batch Progress, where you can review the status of the different batches before you request approval.

## Search for Batch Payouts

Set up filters so you can search for specific batch payouts. Choose from the following filters:

- **Search**: the ID of the batch payout youâ€™re searching for
- **Organisation**: the organisation that made the payout
- **Progress**: the current stage of the batch payout, which can be either Actions pending (batches that still have payments awaiting an action) or All (all batches) Actions pending or All

> ðŸš§ Note

> Within batches, you can approve, book or cancel payouts, and you can also select single payouts to approve, book or cancel independently. There may also be batches where only some payouts are approved, due to payout data errors.
